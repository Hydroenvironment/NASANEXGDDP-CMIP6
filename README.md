# TOOLS FOR NASA NEX GDDP CMIP6 DAILYDATA HANDLING

üåè Global, high resolution, bias-corrected climate change dataset for climate change impact evaluation

‚úÖThe 2013 IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5) featured climate models from CMIP5, while the upcoming 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report (AR6) will feature new state-of-the-art CMIP6 models.

‚úÖCMIP6 will consist of the ‚Äúruns‚Äù from around 100 distinct climate models being produced across 49 different modelling groups. While the results from only around 40 CMIP6 models have been published so far, it is already evident that a number of them have a notably higher climate sensitivity than models in CMIP5

‚úÖThe NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset, or NEX-GDDP-CMIP6, was created to assist the science community in conducting studies of climate change impacts at local to regional scales and to enhance public understanding of possible future climate patterns at the spatial scale of individual towns, cities, and watersheds

‚úÖThis dataset includes downscaled projections from ScenarioMIP model runs for which daily scenarios were produced and distributed through the Earth System Grid Federation. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a set of global, high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions.
